# Bitraq

This is the source for the bitraq application.

I'm not going into too much detail, here.

Although very functional as it is, this is not the __completed__ project. Nor is it the final project. It's a more of an MVP or prototype.

It is fully functional, you can register an account, add and edit projects, and interact with other users to resolve their software bugs and other issues. It's also a fun way to share your projects with other developers and collaborate on projects.


## What is bitraq?

The idea is fairly simple, it's kind of like __StackOverflow__ only rather than ask specific questions related to code, you instead create projects and point to the repository where the code is stored. From there you can produce bug reports and other users can then present solutions to those problems.

When a solution to a problem is accepted - the user who submitted the solution is given a point which is added to their overall score.

All of this is working fairly well - my aim right now is to get the back-end system working fully and tweak the front-end as I go. Once it's where I want it to be and I'm happy with the functionality and features - I may rebuild from scratch, I'm really just fleshing out the concept at this point but it's coming together.

For what it is it's still quite large and complex, quite a few database tables involved and a lot of pages.

It's built using my base framework, so serves as a working example of how to use base to build your own projects.

I'm still working and adding new features, ironing out bugs, refactoring - so will keep this repo up to date as I make changes.
